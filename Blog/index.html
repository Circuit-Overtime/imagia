                <h2>Server API: Catch Glimpses of AI Magic</h2>
                <p>
                    To enhance the functionality of our AI text-to-image generator, we've developed a custom API that
                    handles image generation requests efficiently. Below is a snippet of the server API code that powers
                    the back-end operations:
                </p>
                <pre>
        <i class="bi bi-clipboard copyCode" onclick="copy(this)"></i>
    <code class="python">
    import requests

    def download_image(prompt):
        url = f"https://imgelixpo.vercel.app/c/{prompt}" 
        response = requests.get(url)
        with open('generated_image.jpg', 'wb') as file:
            file.write(response.content)
        print('Image downloaded!')

        download_image("a beautiful garden")
        # write the prompt you want to generate an image for
    </code>
    </pre>

                <p> You can also generate the images using <code class="shortCode">Javascript</code> language for easy
                    integration with your websites. Just paste the code
                    below in your <code class="javascript"> &lt;script&gt; ... &lt;/script&gt; </code> of your HTML code
                    to download a ready image from the prompt and also
                    explore further. </p>
                <pre>
        <i class="bi bi-clipboard copyCode" onclick="copy(this)"></i>
        <code class="javascript">
    const prompt = "a beautiful garden";
    const url = `https://imgelixpo.vercel.app/c/${prompt}`;
    fetch(url)
        .then(response => response.blob())
        .then(blob => {
            const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
            const a = document.createElement('a');
            a.href = url;
            a.download = 'generated_image.jpg';
            document.body.appendChild(a);
            a.click();
            window.URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
        });
        </code>
    </pre>
                <p>
                    <b>Here are the query parameters that can be used to customize the image generation process:</b>
                    <br>
                    <hr>
                    <code class="shortCode">prompt </code> - The text prompt that guides the AI model in generating the
                    image.
                    <br>
                    <code class="shortCode">model </code> - The name of the AI model to use for image generation.
                    <br>
                    <code class="shortCode">seed </code> - A random seed value to control the randomness of the image
                    generation process.
                    <br>
                    <code class="shortCode">enhance </code> - A boolean flag to enable or disable image enhancement
                    techniques using LLM.
                    <br>
                    <code class="shortCode">privateMode </code> - A boolean flag to enable or disable private mode,
                    which prevents the image from being stored on the server.
                    <br>
                    <code class="shortCode">theme </code> - The theme or style of the generated image, such as "nature,"
                    "fantasy," or "sci-fi."
                    <br>
                    <hr>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Server API Rate Limits are also implemented to ensure fair usage and prevent abuse of the system.
                    Users can
                    make a upto <code class="shortCode">10 Image Generation Request/Minute. </code> This rate limit is
                    enforced to maintain the stability and
                    performance of the API, ensuring that all users have equal access to the image generation service.
                    If the rate limit is
                    exceeded then a <code class="shortCode">Err (429) Rate Limit Reached </code> will be thrown. It can
                    be <b> caught </b>
                    using <code class="shortCode"> try {()} .. catch {()} </code> and reflected back on the front-end.

                <h2>The Technology Stack: Building the Foundation</h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a cutting-edge text-to-image generator required a carefully selected blend of technologies,
                    each chosen for its power, flexibility, and ability to handle the complex demands of AI-driven image
                    creation. Here's an in-depth look at the tech stack that powers our innovation:
                </p>
                <h3>Frontend Development</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>HTML & CSS:</strong> We used HTML for structuring the web content, ensuring a semantic
                        and accessible layout. CSS allows us to design a visually appealing interface, providing a
                        responsive and flexible design that adapts to a wide range of devices and screen sizes. We
                        utilize CSS Grid and Flexbox to create dynamic layouts and alignments, ensuring a smooth user
                        experience.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>JavaScript:</strong> JavaScript enhances interactivity on the frontend. It enables
                        dynamic content updates, client-side form validation, and responsive event handling. We leverage
                        modern JavaScript features like ES6+ syntax, promises, and async/await for better code
                        readability and performance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Responsive Design & Accessibility:</strong> We focus on building a fully responsive
                        design using media queries, ensuring that our application is usable on desktops, tablets, and
                        mobile devices. Accessibility is a top priority, with considerations like proper use of ARIA
                        attributes and keyboard navigation to ensure our website is usable by all users, including those
                        with disabilities.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Backend Development</h3>
                <ul>

                        handling, and data processing tasks. With its rich ecosystem of libraries (such as NumPy,
                        Pandas, and TensorFlow), Python allows us to integrate machine learning models and data analysis
                        tasks seamlessly into our backend operations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>MongoDB:</strong> MongoDB is our NoSQL database, chosen for its flexibility in handling
                        unstructured data. It allows us to store data in JSON-like documents, which simplifies the
                        integration with our JavaScript-based stack. With MongoDB's scalability, we can efficiently
                        store and query large datasets, and its high availability features ensure the database can scale
                        horizontally across multiple servers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Authentication & Authorization:</strong> We implement secure user authentication and
                        authorization through JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and OAuth, ensuring that only authorized users can
                        access certain resources. This also includes user session management and role-based access
                        controls.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>AI and Machine Learning</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>PyTorch:</strong> This open-source machine learning library is the backbone of our AI
                        models, chosen for its flexibility and strong community support in deep learning and computer
                        vision tasks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Hugging Face Transformers:</strong> We leverage this library for state-of-the-art
                        natural language processing, crucial for interpreting and understanding user prompts accurately.

                        <strong>Custom GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks):</strong> We've developed and fine-tuned
                        custom GAN models to generate high-quality images that accurately reflect user inputs.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This comprehensive tech stack forms the robust foundation upon which we've built our innovative
                    text-to-image generator. By leveraging these cutting-edge technologies, we've created a tool that's
                    not only powerful and efficient but also scalable and future-proof.

                <h2>Datasets and preprocessing</h2>
                <p>
                    The development of our AI model required carefully curated datasets. Here is an overview of how the
                    data on which our model was trained, was cleaned and preprocessed:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Dataset 1:</strong> Contained gibberish text labeled as <strong>0</strong>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Dataset 2:</strong> Included meaningful text labeled as <strong>1</strong>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Final Dataset:</strong> Both datasets were merged, resulting in a an integrated vast
                        collection of gibberish and meaningful texts. The final dataset included two columns:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Response:</strong> Containing gibberish and meaningful entries.</li>
                            <li><strong>Labels:</strong> Where gibberish was labeled as <strong>0</strong> and
                                meaningful text as <strong>1</strong>.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> After combining, the dataset underwent a thorough cleaning
                        process. Duplicates were removed, text formats were normalized, and irrelevant symbols were
                        eliminated to ensure consistency and prepare the data for model training.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Model Training:</h2>
                <p>
                    To guarantee optimal efficiency and accuracy, the model was trained using a number of well designed
                    methods. A breakdown of the model training process has been given below:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Data Splitting:</strong> The final cleaned dataset was split into three subsets:
                        <ul>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Pipeline Creation:</strong> A pipeline was developed for efficient preprocessing and
                        model training. It consisted of:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Tfidf Vectorizer:</strong> Transformed text data into numerical representations
                                by computing Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) values.</li>
                            <li><strong>Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB):</strong> An algorithm for supervised
                                learning that is particularly suitable for text classification tasks is used to classify
                                text into readable or nonsense categories. It efficiently manages word counts and their
                                distributions.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Hyperparameter Tuning:</strong> The model was trained using
                        <strong>GridSearchCV</strong>, which methodically examined several hyperparameter combinations
                        to determine the configuration that produced optimal performance.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This methodical strategy guaranteed that the model was well optimized and proficient at
                    distinguishing gibberish from meaningful content.
